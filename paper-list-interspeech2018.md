# Interesting papers in INTERSPEECH 2018 (ing)

This list is just depending on my personal interests. :-)
My interests are speech synthesis, emotional TTS, speech animation (lip sync), modeling, end-to-end TTS., etc. Thanks.

### Speaker Adaptation
- Multimodal Speech Synthesis Architecture for Unsupervised Speaker Adaptation; H.-T. Luong and J. Yamagishi
  - Keywords : speaker adaptation, supervised/unsupervised learning, w/o transcription
  - Separating SPSS into Text encoder + Speech encoder + Common layers
  - (supervised learning, w/ transcription) text encoder + common layers
  - (unsupervised learning, w/ speech only) speech encoder + common layers

### A Small Amount of data
- DNN-based Speech Synthesis for Small Data Sets Considering Bidirectional Speech-Text Conversion
  - Keywords : a cycling training, bidirectional, small data sets, speech synthesis
  - like RBM and DBM, two model in one networks, bidirectional

###
- Acoustic modeling
  - LSTBM, sequence representation of speech spectra

### Speech Animation, Lip Sync
- **Joint Learning of Faicial Expression and Head Pose from Speech**
- The effect of Real-Time Constraints on Automatic Speech Animation
  - Keywords : real-time, a trade-off between animation quality and overall latency, BLSTM, future context length

### Peformace measure
- Measuring the cognitive load of synthetic speech using a dual task paradigm
  - Low speech quality ~= slow reaction times (a greate cognitive load) --> listening effort
  - Natural speech != the fastest reaction times (might be near-perfect intelligibility) --> sustained attention
  - Measuring something like the listener's level of sustained attention
